# OPC-UA-Example

This is an exmample for the OPC UA communication developed by Labview 2018.

Two items are added to the OPC UA Server, and then will be read by the client.

To test this program, please open and run the OPC UA Server firstly,

And then open and fill the Server endpoint URL in the client interface,

After running the client you can read two items from the client interface.

Both programs have been tested locally and work well !
